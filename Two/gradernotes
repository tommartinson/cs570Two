I wrote the majority of this code by myself.  I drew ideas for this code from various places.  I setablished the outline of the program based on Foster's recommended inout2.c file.  I browsed the C Programming Language Documentation on devsdocs.io/c in order to discover functions to use in the program.  I also fixed several errors and did some bug fixing based off of some discussion boards on stackoverflow.com.  I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions.
